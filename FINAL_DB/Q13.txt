Implement nested sub queries. Perform a test for set membership (in, not in), set comparison (<some, >=some, <all etc.) and set cardinality (unique, not unique). Assume suitable tables. 
Ans:
-- Create tables
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Alice');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (2, 'Bob');
INSERT INTO students VALUES (3, 'Charlie');

INSERT INTO courses VALUES (101, 'Math');
INSERT INTO courses VALUES (102, 'English');
INSERT INTO courses VALUES (103, 'History');

INSERT INTO enrollments VALUES (1, 1, 101, 85);
INSERT INTO enrollments VALUES (2, 1, 102, 90);
INSERT INTO enrollments VALUES (3, 2, 101, 75);
INSERT INTO enrollments VALUES (4, 2, 103, 88);
INSERT INTO enrollments VALUES (5, 3, 102, 92);
INSERT INTO enrollments VALUES (6, 3, 103, 78);

-- Set Membership (IN, NOT IN)
SELECT student_name
FROM students
WHERE student_id IN (SELECT student_id FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 101);

SELECT student_name
FROM students
WHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 102);

-- Set Comparison (<SOME, >=SOME, <ALL, etc.)
SELECT student_name
FROM students
WHERE grade > SOME (SELECT grade FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 101);

SELECT student_name
FROM students
WHERE grade < ALL (SELECT grade FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 102);

-- Set Cardinality (UNIQUE, NOT UNIQUE)
SELECT student_name
FROM students
WHERE grade = ALL (SELECT grade FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 103)
      AND COUNT(*) = 1;

SELECT student_name
FROM students
WHERE grade = ALL (SELECT grade FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 101)
      AND COUNT(*) > 1;
