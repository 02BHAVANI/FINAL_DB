/*The salary column is defined with the DECIMAL(10, 2) data type. This means that the column can store numbers with up to 10 digits in total, and 2 of those digits can be after the decimal point. So, for example, it can store values like 12345.67.

Here's a breakdown:

10 is the total number of digits (both before and after the decimal point).
2 is the number of digits after the decimal point.
This ensures that the salary values are stored with up to 8 digits before the decimal point and 2 digits after the decimal point. You can adjust these values based on the precision and scale you need for your specific use case.
